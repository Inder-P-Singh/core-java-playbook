# Outputs Directory

This folder is used to store generated artifacts such as:

- logs
- execution reports
- screenshots
- test metrics

Currently empty because:

- this playbook focuses on Java fundamentals
- reporting is introduced in later Selenium and CI/CD sessions

In future sessions, this folder will contain:
- execution logs
- HTML reports
- CI artifacts
